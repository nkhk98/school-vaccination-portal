Backend for School Vaccination Tracking App
Overview
This is the backend component of the School Vaccination Tracking App, a full-stack web application designed to manage and track vaccination drives in a school. The backend is responsible for:

Storing and managing data related to students, vaccination drives, and vaccination records.

Providing APIs for the frontend to access and manipulate this data.

Implementing business logic and data validation.

Features
Data Management:

Stores student information (name, class, student ID, date of birth).

Stores vaccination drive details (date, location, vaccine type).

Stores vaccination records (student, vaccine, date of administration, drive ID).

APIs:

Provides RESTful APIs for:

Managing student records (create, read, update).

Scheduling and managing vaccination drives (create, read, update).

Recording and updating vaccination statuses.

Generating reports (e.g., vaccination records for a student).

Data Validation:

Validates data inputs to ensure data integrity.

Handles errors and provides informative responses.

Database Integration:

Uses [MongoDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite] for data persistence.  (Choose one and specify)

Authentication and Authorization:

(Optional: Implement if required) May include user authentication for school coordinators and role-based authorization to control access to different functionalities.

Technologies Used
Backend Framework: [Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, or any framework of your choice]  (Specify the framework)

Database: [MongoDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite]  (Specify the database)

API Documentation: [Specify how the API is documented, e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger]

Other Libraries: [List any other relevant libraries, e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize]

Getting Started
Prerequisites
[Install Node.js and npm / Python and pip]  (Adjust based on your chosen framework)

[Install MongoDB / PostgreSQL / SQLite]  (Adjust based on your chosen database)

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-vaccination-app-backend.git

Navigate to the backend directory:

cd school-vaccination-app-backend

Install dependencies:

npm install  # For Node.js/Express
pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python/Flask

Configure the database:

Create a .env file in the root directory.

Add your database connection string to the .env file.  For example:

# For MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database_name

# For PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name

#For SQLite
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./database.db

(Modify the above based on your database.  If using a different method for configuration, describe it here.)

Run the database migrations (if applicable):

npx sequelize db:migrate # Example for Sequelize (PostgreSQL)
python manage.py migrate # Example for Django (PostgreSQL)

Start the server:

npm run start  # For Node.js/Express
python app.py  # For Python/Flask

The server will be running at http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured).
